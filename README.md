Fish Bowl - I would like to keep track of my aquarium's water quality. What better way to do that than with an app. Keep track of 1 or more aquariums Nitrate, Nitrite, Hardness, Alkalinity, and pH. View over time how your water quality has changed with a graph. Get recommendations on ways to raise or lower different levels. A little fun part, keep track of the fish in your aquariums and get little fun facts about them.
